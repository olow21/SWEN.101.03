  I went to High School at Guilford High School in Connecticut. In high school, I took a class based on computers and programming. From this, I learned I liked working with computers. I decided to go to college for software engineering and applied to many schools. In the end, I chose RIT and now I am here. In my free time, I like to go hiking. I like finding and exploring different trails. Hiking is fun because I spend a lot of my time inside, so through hiking, I get something different from the regular. I also like reading, and find that it calms me. My favorite book is probably The Old Man and the Sea, but it is too hard to choose.
